# Getting Started

This repository contains the source code and dataset for the paper _'Semantic-based Jointly Learning From Social Media and
 Environmental Data For Disaster Prediction'_ by Hamada Zahera, Mohamed Ahmed Sherif and Axel Ngonga

Our approach predicts the typhoon intensity via a joint learning from social media and environmental data. 
This implementation is written in Python 3.6 and uses Tensorflow 1.4.1.
